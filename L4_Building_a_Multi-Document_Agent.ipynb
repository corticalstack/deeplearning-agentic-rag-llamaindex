Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of trainable normalization and embedding layers in bridging the gap between different components for effective long context adaptation.

The ART focuses on modeling relations between facial action units to aid in forgery detection, while the TAP process tampers AU-related regions to enhance the model's generalization to unseen manipulation methods.

By alternating between quantization and singular value decomposition, LoftQ minimizes the difference between quantized weights and pre-trained weights, providing a beneficial starting point for subsequent fine-tuning. The approach demonstrates effectiveness and robustness, particularly in low-bit quantization scenarios, surpassing existing methods like QLoRA. Additionally, LoftQ utilizes low-rank adapters for neural network compression, applying low-rank approximations to convolutional layers to reduce the memory footprint of models during training and storage phases. This iterative process of quantizing weights and leveraging low-rank matrix approximations optimizes the model's performance while enhancing memory efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art pruning techniques.\n",
